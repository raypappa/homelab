# NON-SINGLETON cluster - 2nd and after HA masters.

# The singleton is any already running k3s controlplane node.  Mostly we
# just need to have the correct node token to use on any other control
# plane node, because we initialize everything on the first one and then
# all other control plane nodes will join on the running node for the
# initial setup.
#
# Otherwise they won't be able to communicate and you'd have three
# isolated control planes, not a single HA control plane.
